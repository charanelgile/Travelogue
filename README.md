## Fun Gang under the Bicol Sun

<br/>

**Description:**
<br/>
This project depicts the student’s experience during his recent travel with friends to the Bicol region - the nature, the islands, the food, the culture, and the fresh perspective he gained after such a wonderful journey.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from being the student’s remembrance blog of his trip to _Bicolandia_, this mini-project is meant for people looking to gain an insight on where to go, what to do, and what to expect when visiting the region.
<br/>
<br/>
The website will give its readers a glimpse of the majestic Mayon Volcano, the Bulusan trail, the pristine Subic Beach of Calintaan, the calm shorelines of Rizal Beach, the ruins of Cagsawa and Barcelona, and other amazing spots that are truly worth seeing.
