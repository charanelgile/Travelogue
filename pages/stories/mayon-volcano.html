          Truly <i>Magayon</i>: The Majestic Mt. Mayon
        </h3>

        <small class="mb-3 mx-3">&nbsp;June 11 - 12, 2023</small>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we left for our flight, the weather was bad
          here in the greater Manila area. There was an LPA and according to the
          weather forecast, the following days will be rainy in the Bicol
          region, too. Moreover, during that time, the Mayon Volcano was
          releasing magma out into its crater. (In fact, for the entirety of our
          trip, Mayon was at Alert Level 3.) So I hoped for the best, but
          prepared myself for the worst.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we landed in Bicol International
          Airport, the weather condition seemed to have improved. “Off to a good
          start”, I said to myself. But as the days went on, we started to
          believe that we got lucky to have a pleasant travel experience
          (weather-wise) all throughout. There was one thing we weren't
          fortunate enough to witness, though — the Mayon Volcano, without the
          clouds covering its tip.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../images/gallery/legazpi/mayon.JPG"
          alt=""
          class="portrait-img rounded-4 border border-3 border-white mx-auto mb-3 p-1 bg-white"
          width="300px" />

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We adapted a backwards approach for this trip. We
          visited the farthest places in our itinerary first, slowly making our
          way back to Legazpi City because we're booked to have our flight back
          home at Bicol International Airport, as well. I was starting to regret
          not making a stopover on our way to Matnog during our first day, when
          we've just landed and Mayon was calmer. We could've searched for a
          good location where we could snap pictures of this massive, perfect
          cone-shaped creation towering in the middle of this rich archipelago.
          I just thought that a visit in the Bicol region would never be
          complete without seeing Mayon in its full glory.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../images/gallery/legazpi/cagsawa-4.JPG"
          alt=""
          class="landscape-img rounded-4 border border-3 border-white mx-auto mb-3 p-1 bg-white"
          width="350px" />

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on, during our 4th day, we've been to Daraga
          Church, the Cagsawa Ruins, Sumlang Lake, and even Quituinan Ranch —
          basically every famous location that offers a great view of Mt. Mayon.
          But I guess we've finally run out of luck. Otherwise, we would be
          looking up by now, with our eyes wide open, completely captivated by
          Mayon's beauty. There were other places we've gone to like Quitinday
          Hills and Hoyop-hoyopan Cave, but the famous volcano is not greatly
          seen from there. I've honestly lost hope at that point.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../images/gallery/legazpi/quituinan-4.JPG"
          alt=""
          class="portrait-img rounded-4 border border-3 border-white mx-auto mb-3 p-1 bg-white"
          width="300px" />

        <img
          src="../../images/gallery/legazpi/hoyop-3.jpg"
          alt=""
          class="portrait-img rounded-4 border border-3 border-white mx-auto mb-3 p-1 bg-white"
          width="300px" />

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the morning before our flight home and it
          seemed like Mayon actually waited for the last minute of our trip
          before giving us its parting gift, which would make our last day here
          more exciting. Even from the rooftop of Casa Vecino, the BNB where
          we're staying, we could see that there was almost no cloud covering
          its crater. We ate our free breakfast as quickly as we could, planned
          our route to the airport, and even asked the Grab Driver that we've
          booked to take us to Highlands. Originally, the plan was to make a
          quick stop at the Boulevard, but that was opposite the direction to
          the airport. So the Highlands was the second most ideal place to
          witness the majestic Mt. Mayon in all its breathtaking charm, and IT..
          WAS.. SO WORTH IT.
        </p>

          class="portrait-img rounded-4 border border-3 border-white mx-auto mb-3 p-1 bg-white"
          width="300px" />

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All things considered, I might even say that we
          were blessed and that fate was on our side. In the end, everything
          worked out (as most things in life do.) It was definitely a core
          memory, one I would never forget.
